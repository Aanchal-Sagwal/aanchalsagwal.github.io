Hi, I am Aanchal (pronounced "Ahn-chull"). I am a pre doctoral fellow in Economics at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago. I am originally from Haryana, India- well from a small village Kaul in district Kaithal in Haryana. I usually skip the details but decided not to anymore. I did my undergrad in Physics at St. Stephen's College, University of Delhi. Then did my masters in Economics at Ashoka University. I worked at the Central Bank in India (known as the Reserve Bank of India) as a Research Associate, post which I joined my current position at University of Chicago.

My current interests lie at the intersection of international macroeconomics, climate change, and inequality. In one of my recent projects, Iâ€™m studying how international sanctions interact with global climate action. Another project, co-authored with Dr. Nirvana Mitra, explores the adoption of fiscal rules and its intersection with political economy. At Booth, I work with Prof. Chris Stewart on a project related to innovation and competition.
